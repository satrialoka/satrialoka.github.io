      in <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/machine-and-human-intelligence" target="_blank">The Machine and Human Intelligence Lab</a>, with <a href="https://lacerbi.github.io/">Luigi Acerbi</a>, at the University of Helsinki, Finland. 
      My work focuses on amortized inference methods and their applications, especially in black-box optimization. My research interests include Bayesian optimization, (deep) neural networks, and their applications in science and engineering.
      Previously, I pursued my PhD in the <a href="https://sumo.ilabt.imec.be/home" target="_blank">SUMO group</a> at Ghent University in Belgium, 
      specializing in Bayesian optimization for engineering applications. Prior to that, 
      I completed my master&#39;s degree at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/takiokurita/" target="_blank">Kurita Laboratory</a>, Hiroshima University in Japan, 
      where my focus was on Deep Neural Networks.
