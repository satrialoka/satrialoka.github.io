      My work focuses on amortized inference methods and their applications, especially in black-box optimization. My research interests include Bayesian optimization, (deep) neural networks, and their applications in science and engineering.
      Previously, I pursued my PhD in the <a href="https://sumo.ilabt.imec.be/home" target="_blank">SUMO group</a> at Ghent University in Belgium, 
      specializing in Bayesian optimization for engineering applications. Prior to that, 
      I completed my master&#39;s degree at <a href="https://kurita-lab.jp/wordpress/" target="_blank">Kurita Laboratory</a>, Hiroshima University in Japan, 
      where my focus was on Deep Neural Networks.
