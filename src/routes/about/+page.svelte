   <h3>Hi welcome to my blog</h3>
   <p> I am a postdoctoral <a href="https://scholar.google.co.id/citations?user=bA9vjiAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">researcher</a>
      at <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/machine-and-human-intelligence" target="_blank">The Machine and Human Intelligence research group</a> in the University of Helsinki, Finland. 
      My work focuses on Bayesian optimization, deep learning, and amortized (inference) optimization.
      Previously, I pursued my PhD research in the <a href="https://sumo.ilabt.imec.be/home" target="_blank">SUMO group</a> at Ghent University in Belgium, 
      specializing in Bayesian Optimization for engineering applications. Prior to that, 
      I completed my master's degree at <a href="https://kurita-lab.jp/wordpress/" target="_blank">Kurita Laboratory</a>, Hiroshima University in Japan, 
      where my focus was on Deep Neural Networks.</p>
