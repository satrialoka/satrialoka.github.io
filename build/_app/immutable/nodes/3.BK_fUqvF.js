      My work focuses on Bayesian optimization, deep learning, and amortized (inference) optimization.
      Previously, I pursued my PhD research in the <a href="https://sumo.ilabt.imec.be/home" target="_blank">SUMO group</a> at Ghent University in Belgium, 
      specializing in Bayesian Optimization for engineering applications. Prior to that, 
      I completed my master&#39;s degree at <a href="https://kurita-lab.jp/wordpress/" target="_blank">Kurita Laboratory</a>, Hiroshima University in Japan, 
      where my focus was on Deep Neural Networks.</p> <br/>`;return{c(){e=h("article"),e.innerHTML=i},l(a){e=p(a,"ARTICLE",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),c(e)!=="svelte-i0pdeg"&&(e.innerHTML=i)},m(a,r){m(a,e,r)},p:t,i:t,o:t,d(a){a&&g(e)}}}class y extends o{constructor(e){super(),l(this,e,null,u,s,{})}}export{y as component};
